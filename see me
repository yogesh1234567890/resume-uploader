This is just a basicc application which takes a pdf file stores in local files directory and reads the contents and renders the data in the page.
Its not perfect but i have tried to maintain.
please use the attached sample.pdf file to upload to see the data .
I havent been able to manage the directory path in views to display any pdfs so its little bit not applicable for other pdfs.
Also the data of skills isnt shown but the whole data is shown.
I couldnt figure out the process and i am still looking into it.

Reviews would be appreciated.
THank you
